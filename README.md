# Spectral Analysis


This program will calculate absorption coefficients via the Beer-Lambert law from transmission spectra.


### Installation


|Operating System | Python Version | Numpy | Scipy | Matplotlib | Tkinter|

|Ubuntu 17.04|       3.11         |  1.13.1 | 0.19.1 |  2.0.2 | 8.6 |

### Running the code

1. First, you will run the code via the terminal with: `python Task_1.py`. 

2. Next, import the data used for analysis. The program will first ask for your raw dataset, followed by your background spectrum. Make sure to give a full path name

3. After importing these data files, the program will save the temperature and concentration of the mixture you are analyzing. The program will ask for both, and will store each answer in a separate txt file within the directory.
